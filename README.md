Yellow Pages scraping script

This script is going to scrape Yellow Pages.

Sample URL:
https://www.yellowpages.com/search?search_terms=james&geo_location_terms=TX&page=5&format=json

Approach:

1. Yellow Pages is going to open.
2. We will change the name & cycle through the geo location shortcode.
3. We will then cycle the name & again cycle the geo location.
4. We'll save the info in csv.
